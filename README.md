Project Description: \
Recently, it has become difficult to find unbiased news sources in the US. To measure this phenomenon, several sites have created ratings of news outlets that draw on experts and multi-partisan analysis to determine a political bias ranking for a given source. In our project, we aim to discover how this bias might be encoded in BERT. Using probes to test for degrees of partisan bias in news sources, we will compare these findings to established ratings such as the AllSides Media Bias Ratings (AMBR).

Dataset: \
We modified the POLUSA dataset which can be found at https://zenodo.org/record/3946057#.Yb-S_dnMIUo \
Access to this dataset is restricted, so we included a small sample of the text files we used to train the models.

Code: \
We added the BERT architecture and all the versions of the models we created.

Models: \
All models not provided in the github are available at https://huggingface.co/Declan

Context and Adjective Lists: \
All adjectives and contexts used to query the model are included in this repository
